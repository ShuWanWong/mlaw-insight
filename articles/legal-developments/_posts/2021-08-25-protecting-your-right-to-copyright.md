### **Time to Suit Up, Paralegals**

<i>Insight MinLaw goes behind the scenes to uncover stories about how the work we do impacts you.</i>
<br>

Whether you realise it or not, contracts are very much part of our daily lives – from signing a certificate to be legally married, to ticking that infamous terms and conditions checkbox when you sign up for a service.

Some contracts are more complex than others, and that’s when a lawyer’s nous comes in handy. While some may opt for private lawyers, those with lesser means will likely require legal aid. The Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) under MinLaw provides civil legal aid for matters including divorce, custody and probate, as well as legal advice and legal assistance in drafting wills, to those who qualify.

We speak to Goh Xin Hui, Latifah Hassan Ali, Rae-Anne Lim and Lynette Heng to find out why these legal aid officers were given the opportunity to suit up for court, and how their work at LAB impacts Singaporeans.

<b><i>Becoming a Specialist</i></b>

At LAB, Legal Officers (LO) are assisted by a team of 20 Legal Executives (LE), who are equivalent to paralegals in private law firms. The LEs undertake a wide variety of work, from taking instructions from applicants for legal aid and managing their cases, to drafting straightforward court documents.
