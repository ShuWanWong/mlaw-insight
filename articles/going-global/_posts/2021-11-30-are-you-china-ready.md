### **Are You China-Ready?**

<i>Insight MinLaw goes behind the scenes to uncover stories about how the work we do impacts you.</i>
<br>

In today’s globalised world, Singapore’s law firms must find new and innovative ways to stand out on the international arena. 

To put our law firms in good stead to seize new opportunities in China, MinLaw launched the first run of the China Ready Programme in August 2020. This builds on Singapore’s deepening bilateral ties with China, particularly in legal and judicial cooperation. The 11-week programme covered legal skills and cultural knowledge, enabling lawyers to navigate through the complex business environment in China. It was developed and delivered by the Han Culture & Education Group (HCEG), a subsidiary of Singapore Press Holdings.

“The China Ready Programme is tailored to address the needs of legal professionals who are interested in the Chinese market, and work with Chinese companies and law firms to meet the needs of businesses,” said Ms Ellis See, 2Director of MinLaw’s Legal Industry Division, which develops Singapore’s legal services sector to meet local, regional and international demands. 

“The modules will help the participants gain a deeper understanding of the Chinese operating environment, legal system and laws; navigate the differences between how Singapore- and China-based businesses work and think; and build up competencies in communicating professionally with Chinese clients in the legal context. The knowledge and networks will help open more doors for Singapore lawyers as both Singapore- and China-based businesses look to expand into the region,” she added.

<b><i>Impact of COVID-19</i></b>

The China Ready Programme returns for a second run in January 2022, after the successful inaugural run. We speak to three Singapore lawyers from the pioneer cohort on their key takeaways and how they put their newfound knowledge to use.

<b><i>Insight MinLaw: Why did you enrol in the programme?</i></b>

Joel: I saw it as a great opportunity to expand my network and explore areas where I can deepen cooperation with existing and new Chinese clients. The course would also enable me to widen my knowledge of Chinese legal concepts and terminology, which would be useful in my line of work.

<b><i>Insight MinLaw: Did the programme meet your objectives and what are your takeaways?</i></b>

Joel: Yes, it has met my objectives of deepening my knowledge of Chinese legal concepts and terminology. I was especially interested in the concept of security under Chinese law and the different ways in which security can be taken or enforced, as these are relevant to restructuring work (which involves understanding what security a company is subject to and the options available to a company in an enforcement scenario). 

Insight MinLaw: How has the programme helped you in your work?

Joel: I was able to immediately put my newfound knowledge to use! Shortly after learning about the concept of a repairer’s lien under Chinese law, I had to deal with Chinese counsel on the same issue, and was able to communicate and understand from a Chinese law perspective why the counterparty had insisted on a particular course of action as a means of protecting their security. 

Insight MinLaw: Tell us one interesting thing you learnt at the programme that you never knew.

Joel: The concept of having a second trial. This is interesting as common law jurisdictions tend to have one trial followed by one (or two) rounds of appeal.

They also highlighted how legal technology can improve access to justice and accuracy of outcomes, while reducing costs. In ‘A World in Transition’ – this year’s theme – countries such as Singapore, which dedicate resources to developing legal technology such as Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) systems, will be best positioned to harness the benefits of such technology whilst helping their local legal communities adapt.

Ms Koh Swee Yen Partner, Commercial & Corporate Disputes and International Arbitration Practices, WongPartnership LLP, said that she found her time at UNCITRAL Academy to be an engaging and enriching experience. As a panellist at the Opening Panel Discussion, she had the chance to discuss with business leaders the challenges they face today. “We spoke about digital acceleration, challenges of climate change and the importance of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance),” she said.  “From my perspective as a lawyer, it is very important to appreciate these business challenges and see how the law responds to it,” she added. 

<b><i>Workshops and Roundtable</i></b>

MinLaw and UNCITRAL partnered with the Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy (SIDRA), the Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to hold a series of capacity-building workshops for representatives from governments and the industry (including general counsel and executives).

The workshops introduced participants to topics such as using mediation and its benefits as a dispute resolution tool, the Convention and its mechanics, how States can build a framework and ecosystem to facilitate and encourage mediation and the use of mediation to resolve investor-State disputes. An exchange session between industry and government representatives offered both groups a platform to engage in discussions on the benefits of using mediation as a dispute resolution tool and how the ecosystem can encourage its use.

As part of SC Week, Minister Tong also hosted a roundtable with 23 young international dispute resolution practitioners from 18 jurisdictions. They had an engaging dialogue on how the pandemic had impacted them, what could be improved on, and how they could work together.

<b><i>Looking Forward</i></b>

“The Singapore Convention Week has put into focus how we should look ahead on certain trends that will come about as a result of technology, COVID-19 and more countries signing on to the Convention,” said Mr Wan Kwong Weng, Group Chief Corporate Officer at Mapletree Investments Pte Ltd and Vice President at Singapore Corporate Counsel Association, who attended the UNCITRAL Academy events.  

Indeed, SC Week has provided a platform for an exchange of rich insights on international dispute resolution. As part of its longstanding commitment to promote the development, understanding and use of international dispute resolution, Singapore will continue to facilitate such discussions and looks forward to welcoming the international community at the next edition of SC Week, which will include the UNCITRAL Academy 2022 and will be held from 29 August to 2 September 2022.
