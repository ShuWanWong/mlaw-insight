We aim to demystify legal speak to ensure that Singapore’s legal framework is clear and transparent to all.

In line with our vision, “A trusted legal system, a trusted Singapore”, MinLaw believes that keeping the legal industry and community abreast with latest trends and developments, as well as staying relevant, upholds a strong foundation for an evolving Singapore.

The Ministry of Law plays the following key roles:

* To formulate and review legal, intellectual property, land, insolvency, public trustee, moneylending, pawnbroking, legal aid and community mediation policies, as well as legislation and strategies under MinLaw's purview;

* To provide legal and policy input for other Ministries' proposed Bills and programmes; and

* To develop the legal services, alternative dispute resolution and intellectual property sectors.

* To regulate and license all law practice entities and register foreign-qualified lawyers in Singapore.<br><br>
